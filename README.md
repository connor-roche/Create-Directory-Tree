# Create Directory Tree

A Linux Bash script, create.sh which creates a directory tree with depth d and breadth b in a programmable depth/breadth-first fashion, where depth-first or breadth-first can be controlled by a command line parameter. Depth refers to the level of the directory tree while breadth refers to the number of directories a directory may have. The script handles any depth and breadth.
